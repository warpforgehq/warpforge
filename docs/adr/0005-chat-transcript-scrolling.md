# 0005 — The virtualiser owns the chat scroll, and the transcript arrives whole

**Status:** accepted (2026-08-30)

Applies to `desktop/src/components/SessionChat.tsx`, `desktop/src/lib/chatScroll.ts`
and the `session_history` field of the daemon snapshot
(`crates/warpforge-protocol/src/event.rs`, `src/daemon/actor.rs`).

## Context

The task transcript is a `LegendList` (`@legendapp/list` 3.3.5, plus the
anchoring patch in `desktop/patches/`) over hundreds to thousands of rows. Only
the rows near the viewport are ever measured; everything else is sized from a
running per-type average. Two independent mechanisms can move the scroll:

- `maintainScrollAtEnd` — the list pins itself to the true end while the
  viewport is inside the follow zone.
- `maintainVisibleContentPosition` (MVCP) — the list picks an anchor row and
  compensates the scroll offset so that row stays put as content around it
  resizes.

Both compute in the same currency: estimated content size. Four separate
attempts to stop long chats jerking upward on every new message each fixed one
symptom and left the cause standing. The two causes turned out to be *both
mechanisms running at once*, and *the transcript arriving in two pieces*.

The second one came from the cold-start work: the connection snapshot carried
only a 200-row tail per task and the desktop fetched the rest per task after
open, prepending it above the viewport. Every prepended row was unmeasured, so
the list's total-size estimate lurched the moment they took real sizes, and the
offset the list was holding no longer pointed at the same message. Attempts to
paper over that — re-pinning across two frames after the backfill, then hiding
the list behind a placeholder until the backfill landed — traded one artefact
for another; the second also made every long chat open on a spinner.

## Decisions

**While following the live edge, `maintainScrollAtEnd` owns the scroll and MVCP
is off.** `transcriptRestoreMode` (chatScroll.ts) returns `"none"` in that
state, and `SessionChat` passes `undefined` for
`maintainVisibleContentPosition`. Anchoring while following means MVCP's
compensating adjust races the end-pin over estimates that churn on every
streamed token, and the viewport walks upward by the drift. *Rejected:*
`{data: false, size: true}` while following — that was the pre-`65f87c7`
shape, and turning `data` off let per-type averages drift unchecked, which is
the same slide from the other direction. The lesson is not "which MVCP flags",
it is "not two owners".

**Anchoring is for reading and for disclosure settle.** Once the user scrolls
away from the end, MVCP restores every row (`"all"`) so the reading position
survives content streaming in below. While a work-group disclosure settles,
MVCP restores only the toggled row (`"anchor"`, keyed on
`work-toggle:${groupId}`) so the trigger stays under the cursor instead of the
viewport chasing the end, and `maintainScrollAtEnd` is suspended for the two
frames the settle takes.

**The follow-zone threshold stays generous (0.2 of the viewport).** The list
derives distance-from-end from estimated content size, and estimate error over
unmeasured rows inflates it. A tight band (0.05 was tried) makes the list stop
pinning while the app still believes it is following — at which point nothing
stabilises the scroll at all.

**The transcript arrives in one piece.** A mounted transcript is only ever
appended to — but *when* it mounts is the lever cold start pulls. The
connection snapshot carries tasks and metadata only (zero transcripts), and a
chat fetches its own task's whole folded history via `session.history`
(`Command::SessionHistory`, `DaemonHandle::session_history`,
`Store::load_session_updates`), mounting the list only once that fetch has
resolved. Until it resolves — successfully or not — the chat shows a brief
placeholder, so nothing can appear above the viewport of a mounted list. An
earlier variant of this split the delivery: the snapshot carried a 200-row
tail, the chat rendered it immediately and backfilled the rest above the
viewport, and every prepended row was unmeasured (see Context). The mistake
was one truncated payload serving two purposes — the sidebar's summaries and
the chat's transcript — not lazy loading itself. Summaries now degrade instead:
live events refill `state.sessionUpdates` as they arrive, and
`TaskInfo.pending_permission` (computed daemon-side at snapshot time) keeps the
"needs you" badge honest without any transcript. The whole retention lifecycle
(transcript prune, auto-settle, task expiry, Settings UI, daily sweep) is what
bounds the database.

**Pinning goes through the scroller node, not `listRef.scrollToEnd()`.** The
imperative method resolves an absolute target from frozen size estimates, so in
a long transcript it lands where the estimate claimed the end was — possibly
outside the follow zone, where nothing re-pins.

## Invariants

1. **Never two scroll owners at once.** If `maintainScrollAtEnd` is active,
   `maintainVisibleContentPosition` must be `undefined`, and vice versa. This
   is the whole content of `transcriptRestoreMode`; any new scroll behaviour
   goes through that function rather than beside it.
2. **Nothing is prepended above the viewport after the list mounts.** A task's
   rows may only be appended. A transcript therefore mounts *after* its full
   fetch resolves — a placeholder stands in until then. Any future cold-start
   optimisation must keep this; the alternative costs a scroll jump per
   prepend, which no amount of re-pinning hides.
3. **`{data: true, size: true}` whenever MVCP is on.** `size` stabilisation
   keeps the total content size from moving by the estimate drift times the
   unmeasured row count; `data` keeps it stable across each streaming delta.
   Turning either off has been tried and slides the view into old messages.
4. **`maintainScrollAtEndThreshold` is a wide band, not a pixel-tight one.**
   It is measured against estimated content length, not the DOM.
5. **The MVCP object is built in a `useMemo` in the component body**, not
   inline in JSX. A hook inside a prop expression is invisible to the rules of
   hooks the moment anything wraps that element in a condition.
6. **Only an upward gesture detaches following.** Scrolling down, clicking a
   file link, expanding a work group and selecting text are not navigation away
   from the latest message.
7. **`@legendapp/list` is patched.** `desktop/patches/@legendapp%2Flist@3.3.5.patch`
   bounds the anchored end-space by a known-size cap and propagates shrinks
   before the list is ready. Note that as of 3.3.5 the code it edits sits
   entirely inside `if (anchoredEndSpace)`, and nothing in `src/` passes that
   prop — so the patch is currently inert here. It still pins the version.
8. **Gesture handlers are React props on the list, never hand-attached to
   `getScrollableNode()`.** The imperative version asked for the node inside a
   single `requestAnimationFrame` and gave up silently when the list had not
   populated its ref yet — which is the common case on a cold mount. Traced
   across two full sessions: not one detach ever fired, `following` stayed true
   forever, and the chat pinned to the end no matter how hard the user scrolled
   away. Switching to another task and back "fixed" it only because that
   re-runs the effect against a ready ref.
9. **An upward gesture outranks the re-arm band.** Leaving the end crosses
   `CHAT_FOLLOW_REARM_PX` on the way out — traced at six consecutive events
   between -51 and 15 — so re-arming on distance alone undid the gesture in the
   same tick it happened. A wheel-up inside `GESTURE_WINDOW_MS` suppresses it.
10. **`drawDistance` is margin against wrong estimates, not against speed.**
   Unmeasured rows are sized by the average of their `getItemType`, and
   `agent_text` spans one-line replies to two-thousand-pixel answers, so its
   average badly overstates the short ones. At 250 the window only had to cover
   ~1000px, which a single overestimated row satisfied alone: traced rendering
   exactly one row (`start: 414, end: 414` of 494) into an 840px viewport, with
   the rest of the screen blank.
11. **Clipping a message with CSS does not make it cheap.** `CollapsibleMarkdown`
   hid overflow behind `max-h-44` while still parsing and highlighting the whole
   string. A pasted log of a few thousand lines paid its full render for 176px
   of output, synchronously — the main thread stalled long enough that text
   could not be selected and the composer refused input, always at the same
   scroll position. Collapsed messages render a bounded prefix instead.

## Debugging

Every fix in this record after the first four came from instrumenting the
scroll machine and reading the numbers; the ones before came from reading the
code, and each fixed a real contributing cause without curing the symptom.

The instrumentation is not kept in the tree — it is a dozen `traceScroll` calls
and a ring buffer, cheaper to rewrite than to maintain. What matters is what to
record, learned the hard way:

- the list's own render window from `getState()` — `start`, `end`,
  `startBuffered`, `endBuffered` against `data.length`. A window of one row
  against an 840px viewport is what "messages disappeared" actually was.
- whether the gesture listeners ever attached, and after how many frames, kept
  somewhere a buffer reset cannot clear. Its absence reads identically to a
  stale build, which cost two rounds.
- one entry per detach, deduplicated. A single wheel gesture emits dozens, and
  each lands twice — the list spreads unknown props onto two nested nodes.

Record from the first frame, not from when a console is opened: the interesting
events happen while the transcript mounts. And always cold-reload before
judging a fix — a warm app has its row measurements cached, produces no height
churn, and looks fixed when it is not.

## Consequences

- `mergeSessionHistory` exists to reconcile a task's fetched transcript with
  the live updates that arrived while the fetch was in flight — the live copy
  folds raw frames, the fetch returns a folded history, so they are not
  positional suffixes of each other.
- `DaemonClient.loadSessionHistory` always resolves, even when the daemon
  cannot answer; a chat then mounts on an empty transcript and refills from
  live events. A failed fetch is retried on the next open of the task.
- Connecting to a large database no longer reads the transcripts table at all:
  the snapshot is tasks and metadata only, and each chat pays for exactly one
  indexed per-task read.
