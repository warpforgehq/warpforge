# Architecture decision records

Decisions that are **not recoverable from the code**: what was chosen, what was
rejected, and which invariants a future change must not break. If something can
be learned by reading the code, it does not belong here — that duplication goes
stale and then misleads.

- One file per decision or per coherent cluster of decisions, numbered:
  `NNNN-short-slug.md`.
- Records are append-only. Don't rewrite a decision that changed — add a new
  record and mark the old one `Superseded by NNNN`.
- Keep each one short enough to read in full before touching the subsystem.
  The **Invariants** section is the part that prevents regressions; put real
  effort there and name the module it applies to.
