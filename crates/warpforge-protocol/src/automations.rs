//! Wire types for scheduled automations.
//!
//! An automation is a named prompt that the daemon runs on a schedule, with a
//! chosen agent and an explicit per-automation model. Every run becomes a real
//! daemon task, so the transcript, diff and runtime context of a scheduled run
//! are the same objects a hand-created task has — an [`AutomationRun`] is just
//! the bookkeeping row that links the two.
//!
//! `Method` variants live in `method.rs` and `Event` variants in `event.rs`
//! (those enums must stay exhaustive in one file); everything they carry lives
//! here.
