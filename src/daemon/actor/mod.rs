//! The daemon actor: a single tokio task that owns all runtime state (projects,
//! dev servers, port-forwards, agent PTYs, tasks) and is the sole mutator of it.
//!
//! Clients (the TUI, the WebSocket server) never touch the managers directly —
//! they send [`Command`]s in and consume [`Event`]s out. This is the
//! daemon/client boundary the pivot is about: because every observer is on the
//! same event stream, there is no "primary" UI, and nothing assumes a single
//! consumer.
//!
//! The internal [`Event`] here is intentionally *not* the serializable wire type
//!(`warpforge_protocol::Event`): in-process it can carry rich handles like the
//! live vt100 parser. A thin translation to the wire type lives in the socket
//! server (`crate::daemon::server`).
